<h2>What is Vergeflix-GUI?</h2>
<p>
 Vergelix GUI is an enhancement of the Vergelix project. In this project I have implemented a GUI so that the user can manage the program through Java Swing.
 In addition, I have implemented the functionality of being able to save the data in files and load them if the user wanted. </br>
 I have also made use of error handling. This project has been gratifying because I have been able to create an app as I thought they were since I started.
 Specifically I have learned:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>User interfaces are very important as they help the user to manage the application. If you don't have a good GUI, the user won't even use our app.</li>
 <li>Error handling is important when using things like files.</li>
 <li>We must validate the data from the beginning so that there are no vulnerabilities in our code.</li>
</ol>
